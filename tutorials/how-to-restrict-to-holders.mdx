Raffl allows you to create exclusive raffles that can only be joined by holders of a specific token. Here's how to create a holder-exclusive raffle:

<Steps>

<Step title="Start Creating Your Raffle">
Follow the steps to create a raffle as detailed in "How to Create a Raffle on Raffl".
</Step>

<Step title="Specify Holder Restriction">
In the "Create Raffle" form, you will find an option to "Add Token Gating". Select this option if you want to create a holder-exclusive raffle.
</Step>

<Step title="Define the Token">
After selecting the holder restriction option, you'll be asked to define the token. Input the contract address of the token you want to restrict your raffle to. You are able to restrict users to join the raffle only if they hold certain tokens (ERC-20 or ERC-721).

- Example A: you can restrict the raffle to holders that has a minimum of 100 LINK (Token).
- Example B: you can restrict the raffle to holders that has a minimum of 100 LINK (Token) and 20 USDC (Token).
- Example C: you can restrict the raffle to holders that has a minimum of 50 GRT (Token) and at least 2 Invisible Friends (NFT).
