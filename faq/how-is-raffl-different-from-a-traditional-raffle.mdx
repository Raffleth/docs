title: How is Raffl different from traditional raffles and lotteries?
---

Raffl is a decentralized platform that allows users to create and participate in raffles and lotteries with ERC-20 or ERC-721 tokens. Leveraging the power of blockchain technology, Raffl provides an unprecedented level of transparency, fairness, and security compared to traditional raffles and lotteries.

In traditional raffles and lotteries, the processes are often opaque and centralized, which may leave participants unsure of whether the results are fair. On the other hand, Raffl operates through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and decentralization. Participants can verify the rules of a raffle, the number of entries, the prizes, and even the result of the draw directly on the blockchain.

Furthermore, the draw in Raffl is automated and utilizes Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function), a trusted source of randomness that is not only truly random but also verifiable and tamper-proof. This ensures that the winners are picked fairly, without any bias or possibility of manipulation.

Raffl's unique approach brings a new level of trust and engagement to the world of raffles and lotteries, making it a fun, fair, and secure platform for everyone.
