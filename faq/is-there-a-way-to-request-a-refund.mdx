<Note>
Tip: A raffle is considered cancelled whenever the deadline is hit but the minimum required entries are not reached.
</Note>

In the event that a raffle is cancelled, Raffl allows participants to request a refund on their entries. A raffle gets cancelled if it fails to reach the minimum required entries before the deadline. Here's how you can request a refund:

1. **Check if the Raffle is Cancelled:** A raffle is cancelled if it does not meet its minimum entries requirement by the draw date. If a raffle is cancelled, it enters a refund stage.

2. **Go to the Raffle Page:** Visit the page of the raffle for which you want to request a refund.

3. **Request a Refund:** If the raffle is in the refund stage, you will see a "Request Refund" button on the raffle page. Click this button to start the refund process.

4. **Confirm Your Request:** Confirm your refund request. This will initiate a transaction in your web3 wallet. Approve the transaction to finalize your refund request.

Upon successful transaction, your entries will be refunded back to your wallet.
