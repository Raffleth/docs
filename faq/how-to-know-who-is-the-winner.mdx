Finding out who won a raffle on Raffl is simple and transparent. The selection of the winner is handled by the Chainlink VRF, a secure and verifiable random number generator. Here's how you can find out who won a raffle:

1. **Wait for the Draw:** Once a raffle meets its minimum entries requirement and reaches its draw date, the Chainlink VRF will automatically select a winner.

2. **Check the Raffle Page:** Visit the raffle page on the Raffl website. After the draw, the winner's address will be displayed on the raffle page.

3. **Look for the WinnerSelected Event:** The smart contract will emit a "**WinnerSelected**" event once the winner has been chosen. You can also verify this event on the Ethereum blockchain for added transparency.

Remember, all processes on Raffl, including the selection of winners, are transparent and can be verified on the blockchain.
