Winning a raffle on Raffl is exciting and claiming your reward is straightforward. The process is automated to ensure fairness and efficiency. Here's how it works:

1. **Wait for the Draw:** Once the raffle reaches its draw date and the minimum entries requirement is met, the Chainlink VRF will automatically pick a winner.

2. **Automatic Reward Dispersal:** If you are chosen as the winner, the smart contract automatically disperses the rewards to your wallet. This means the ERC-20 and/or ERC-721 tokens that you've won will automatically appear in your wallet.

3. **Check Your Wallet:** You can confirm receiving your rewards by checking your wallet. The new tokens should be reflected in your wallet balance.

Remember, all processes including the dispersal of rewards on Raffl are automated and transparent, ensuring fairness and security.
