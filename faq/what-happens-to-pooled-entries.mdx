title: What happens to the pooled entries?
---

The pooled entries in a raffle on Raffl play a vital role in incentivizing the creation of more engaging and rewarding raffles. Once a raffle has successfully concluded and a winner has been chosen, the pooled entries are automatically transferred to the raffle creator's wallet. This transaction is transparent and can be verified on the blockchain.

The pooled entries essentially act as a form of revenue for the raffle creator. They can be used to fund more raffles, support a cause, or any other purpose as decided by the creator.

However, in the event that a raffle does not meet the minimum entries requirement and is cancelled, the smart contract will enable the participants to withdraw their entries without any penalties.
