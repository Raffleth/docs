title: What Happens if the Draw is Not Made?
description: Learn how Raffl handles when your Raffl did not reached the minimum entries to draw.
---

On Raffl, the draw for a raffle is automated and is expected to occur on the specified draw date. However, if a draw is not made, it's typically because the raffle did not meet the minimum entries requirement before the draw date.

In such a scenario, the raffle is cancelled, and the smart contract enters a refund stage. The smart contract will emit a "**DeadlineFailedCriteria**" event, signaling that the raffle did not meet its entry criteria. Here's what happens next:

1. **Refunds:** When a raffle is cancelled, participants can request refunds for their entries. Likewise, the raffle creator can request a refund for the prizes they put up for the raffle.

2. **How to Request Refunds:** Participants and raffle creators can visit the raffle page and click on the "Request Refund" button to start the refund process.

Remember, on Raffl, your funds are secured by the smart contract. If a raffle doesn't proceed as planned, you can always retrieve your tokens.
