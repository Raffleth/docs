title: Can I Manually Cancel a Raffle?
---

On Raffl, the cancellation of a raffle and the ensuing withdrawal process is handled by smart contracts and is largely automated. The only scenario under which a raffle can be cancelled is if it does not meet the minimum entries requirement by the deadline.

When a raffle is cancelled, it automatically enters a refund stage. The smart contract will allow both participants and the raffle creator to request the refund of their entries and prizes respectively.

It's important to note that neither participants nor the raffle creator can manually cancel a withdrawal once the refund stage has started. This process is governed by the rules of the smart contract to ensure fairness and transparency.
