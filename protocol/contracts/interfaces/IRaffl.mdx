[Git Source](https://github.com/Raffleth/protocol/blob/d0e7a98ac74e241068705b47dbc09c29744e1867/src/interfaces/IRaffl.sol)

*Interface that describes the Prize struct, the GameStatus and initialize function so the `RafflFactory` knows
how to initialize the `Raffl`.*


## Functions
### initialize

Initializes the contract by setting up the raffle variables and the
`prices` information.


```solidity
function initialize(
    address entryToken,
    uint256 entryPrice,
    uint256 minEntries,
    uint256 deadline,
    address creator,
    Prize[] calldata prizes,
    TokenGate[] calldata tokenGates,
    ExtraRecipient calldata extraRecipient
)
    external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`entryToken`|`address`|       The address of the ERC-20 token as entry. If address zero, entry is the network token|
|`entryPrice`|`uint256`|       The value of each entry for the raffle.|
|`minEntries`|`uint256`|       The minimum number of entries to consider make the draw.|
|`deadline`|`uint256`|         The block timestamp until the raffle will receive entries and that will perform the draw if criteria is met.|
|`creator`|`address`|          The address of the raffle creator|
|`prizes`|`Prize[]`|           The prizes that will be held by this contract.|

```solidity
function criteriaMet() external view returns (bool);
```

```solidity
function upkeepPerformed() external view returns (bool);
```

### setSuccessCriteria

Sets the criteria as settled, sets the `GameStatus` as `DrawStarted` and emits event
`DeadlineSuccessCriteria`

```solidity
function setSuccessCriteria(uint256 requestId) external;
```

### setFailedCriteria

`DeadlineFailedCriteria`

*Access control: `factory` is the only allowed to called this method*


```solidity
function setFailedCriteria() external;
```

### buyEntries

Purchase entries for the raffle.

*Handles the acquisition of entries for three scenarios:
i) Entry is paid with network tokens,
ii) Entry is paid with ERC-20 tokens,
iii) Entry is free (allows up to 1 entry per user)*


```solidity
function buyEntries(uint256 quantity) external payable;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`quantity`|`uint256`|The quantity of entries to purchase. Requirements: - If entry is paid with network tokens, the required amount of network tokens. - If entry is paid with ERC-20, the contract must be approved to spend ERC-20 tokens. - If entry is free, no payment is required. Emits `EntriesBought` event|


### refundEntries

Refund entries for a specific user.

*Invokable when the draw was not made because the min entries were not enought*

*This method is not available if the `entryPrice` was zero*


```solidity
function refundEntries(address user) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`user`|`address`|The address of the user whose entries will be refunded.|


### refundPrizes

Refund prizes to the creator.

*Invokable when the draw was not made because the min entries were not enought*


```solidity
function refundPrizes() external payable;
```

### disperseRewards

Transfers the `prizes` to the provably fair and verifiable entrant, sets the `GameStatus` as
`SuccessDraw` and emits event `DrawSuccess`

*Access control: `factory` is the only allowed to called this method through the Chainlink VRF Coordinator*


```solidity
function disperseRewards(uint256 requestId, uint256 randomNumber) external;
```

## Structs
### Prize
*`asset` represents the address of the asset considered as a prize*

*`assetType` defines the type of asset*

*`value` represents the value of the prize. If asset is an ERC20, it's the amount. If asset is an ERC721,
it's the tokenId.*


```solidity
struct Prize {
    address asset;
    AssetType assetType;
    uint256 value;
}
```

### TokenGate
*`token` represents the address of the token gating asset*

*`amount` represents the minimum value of the token gating*


```solidity
struct TokenGate {
    address token;
    uint256 amount;
}
```

### ExtraRecipient
*`recipient` represents the address of the extra recipient of the pooled funds*

*`feePercentage` is the percentage of the pooled funds (after fees) that will be shared to the extra
recipient*


```solidity
struct ExtraRecipient {
    address recipient;
    uint64 sharePercentage;
}
```

## Enums
### AssetType
*Asset type describe the kind of token behind the prize tok describes how the periods between release
tokens.*


```solidity
enum AssetType {
    ERC20,
    ERC721
}
```

### GameStatus
*GameStatus defines the possible states of the game
(0) Initialized: Raffle is initialized and ready to receive entries until the deadline
(1) FailedDraw: Raffle deadline was hit by the Chailink Upkeep but minimum entries were not met
(2) DrawStarted: Raffle deadline was hit by the Chainlink Upkeep and it's waiting for the Chainlink VRF
with the lucky winner
(3) SuccessDraw: Raffle received the provably fair and verifiable random lucky winner and distributed rewards.*


```solidity
enum GameStatus {
    Initialized,
    FailedDraw,
    DrawStarted,
    SuccessDraw
}
```
