|`user`|`address`||


### poolFeeData

Returns the current pool fee for a specific Raffle, considering any pending updates.


```solidity
function poolFeeData(address user) external view returns (address feeCollectorAddress, uint64 poolFeePercentage);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`user`|`address`|Address of the user.|


### scheduleGlobalCreationFee

Sets a new global creation fee value, to take effect after 1 hour.

*`msg.sender` has to be the fee collector of the factory.*


```solidity
function scheduleGlobalCreationFee(uint64 newFeeValue) external override onlyFeeCollector;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`newFeeValue`|`uint64`|Value for `creationFee` that will be charged on `Raffl`'s deployments.|


### scheduleGlobalPoolFee

Sets a new global pool fee percentage, to take effect after 1 hour.

*Percentages and fees are calculated using 18 decimals where 1 ether is 100%.
Requirements:
- `newFeePercentage` must be within minPoolFee and maxPoolFee.
- `msg.sender` has to be the fee collector of the factory.*


```solidity
function scheduleGlobalPoolFee(uint64 newFeePercentage) external override onlyFeeCollector;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`newFeePercentage`|`uint64`|Value for `poolFeePercentage` that will be charged on `Raffl`'s pools.|


### scheduleCustomCreationFee

Sets a new custom creation fee value for a specific User, to be enabled and take effect
after 1 hour from the time of this transaction.

*Allows the contract owner to modify the creation fee associated with a specific User.
The new fee becomes effective after a delay of 1 hour, aiming to provide a buffer for users to be aware of the
upcoming fee change.
This function updates the fee and schedules its activation, ensuring transparency and predictability in fee
adjustments.
The fee is specified in wei, allowing for granular control over the fee structure. Emits a
`CustomCreationFeeChange` event upon successful fee update.
Requirements:
- `msg.sender` has to be the fee collector of the factory.*


```solidity
function scheduleCustomCreationFee(address user, uint64 newFeeValue) external override onlyFeeCollector;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`user`|`address`|Address of the `user`.|
|`newFeeValue`|`uint64`|The new creation fee amount to be set, in wei, to replace the current fee after the specified delay.|


### scheduleCustomPoolFee

Sets a new custom pool fee percentage for a specific User, to be enabled and take effect
after 1 hour from the time of this transaction.

*This function allows the contract owner to adjust the pool fee for a User.
The fee adjustment is delayed by 1 hour to provide transparency and predictability. Fees are calculated with
precision to 18 decimal places, where 1 ether equals 100% fee.
The function enforces fee limits; `newFeePercentage` must be within the predefined 0-`MAX_POOL_FEE` bounds.
If the custom fee was previously disabled or set to a different value, this operation schedules the new fee to
take effect after the delay, enabling it if necessary.
Emits a `CustomPoolFeeChange` event upon successful execution.
Requirements:
- `msg.sender` has to be the fee collector of the factory.
- `newFeePercentage` must be within the range limited by `MAX_POOL_FEE`.*


```solidity
function scheduleCustomPoolFee(address user, uint64 newFeePercentage) external override onlyFeeCollector;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`user`|`address`|Address of the `user`.|
|`newFeePercentage`|`uint64`|The new pool fee percentage to be applied, expressed in ether terms (18 decimal places) where 1 ether represents 100%.|


### toggleCustomCreationFee

Enables or disables the custom creation fee for a given Raffle, with the change taking effect
after 1 hour.

*`msg.sender` has to be the fee collector of the factory.*


```solidity
function toggleCustomCreationFee(address user, bool enable) external override onlyFeeCollector;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`user`|`address`|Address of the `user`.|
|`enable`|`bool`|True to enable the fee, false to disable it.|


### toggleCustomPoolFee

*`msg.sender` has to be the fee collector of the factory.*


```solidity
function toggleCustomPoolFee(address user, bool enable) external override onlyFeeCollector;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`user`|`address`|Address of the `user`.|
|`enable`|`bool`|True to enable the fee, false to disable it.|


### _getCurrentFee

Calculates the current fee based on global, custom, and upcoming fee data.

*This function considers the current timestamp and determines the appropriate fee
based on whether a custom or upcoming fee should be applied.*


```solidity
function _getCurrentFee(
    uint64 globalValue,
    UpcomingFeeData memory upcomingGlobalFee,
    CustomFeeData memory customFee
)
    internal
    view
    returns (uint64 currentValue);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`globalValue`|`uint64`|The default global fee value used when no custom fees are applicable.|
|`upcomingGlobalFee`|`UpcomingFeeData`|A struct containing data about an upcoming fee change, including the timestamp for the change and the new value to be applied.|
|`customFee`|`CustomFeeData`|A struct containing data about the custom fee, including its enablement status, timestamps for changes, and its values (current and new).|

**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`currentValue`|`uint64`|The calculated current fee value, taking into account the global value, custom fee, and upcoming fee data based on the current timestamp.|


### _processCreationFee

Processes the creation fee for a transaction.

*This function retrieves the creation fee data from the manager contract and, if the creation fee is greater
than zero, sends the `msg.value` to the fee collector address. Reverts if the transferred value is less than the
required creation fee or if the transfer fails.*


```solidity
function _processCreationFee(address user) internal;
```
