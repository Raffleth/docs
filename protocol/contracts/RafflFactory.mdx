Raffl is a decentralized platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to create and participate
in raffles/lotteries with complete transparency, security, and fairness.

*The RafflFactory contract can be used to create raffle contracts, leveraging Chainlink VRF and Chainlink
Automations.*


## State Variables
### keyHash
*Max gas to bump to*


```solidity
bytes32 keyHash;
```


### callbackGasLimit
*Callback gas limit for the Chainlink VRF*


```solidity
uint32 callbackGasLimit = 500_000;
```


### requestConfirmations
*Number of requests confirmations for the Chainlink VRF*


```solidity
uint16 requestConfirmations = 3;
```


### subscriptionId
*Chainlink subscription ID*


```solidity
uint256 public subscriptionId;
```


### implementation
The address that will be used as a delegate call target for `Raffl`s.


```solidity
address public immutable implementation;
```


### _salt
*It will be used as the salt for create2*


```solidity
bytes32 internal _salt;
```


### _raffles
*Maps the created `Raffl`s addresses*


```solidity
mapping(address => bool) internal _raffles;
```


### _requestIds
*Maps the VRF `requestId` to the `Raffl`s address*


```solidity
mapping(uint256 => address) internal _requestIds;
```


### _activeRaffles
*Stores the active raffles, which upkeep is pending to be performed*


```solidity
ActiveRaffle[] internal _activeRaffles;
```


## Functions
### constructor

*Creates a `Raffl` factory contract.
Requirements:
- `implementationAddress` has to be a contract.
- `feeCollectorAddress` can't be address 0x0.
- `poolFeePercentage` must be within 0 and maxFee range.
- `vrfCoordinator` can't be address 0x0.*


```solidity
constructor(
    address implementationAddress,
    address feeCollectorAddress,
    uint64 creationFeeValue,
    uint64 poolFeePercentage,
    address vrfCoordinator,
    bytes32 _keyHash,
    uint256 _subscriptionId
)
    VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus(vrfCoordinator);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`implementationAddress`|`address`|Address of `Raffl` contract implementation.|
|`feeCollectorAddress`|`address`|  Address of `feeCollector`.|
|`creationFeeValue`|`uint64`|   Value for `creationFee` that will be charged on new `Raffl`s deployed.|
|`poolFeePercentage`|`uint64`|   Value for `poolFeePercentage` that will be charged from the `Raffl`s pool on success draw.|
|`vrfCoordinator`|`address`|VRF Coordinator address|
|`_keyHash`|`bytes32`|The gas lane to use, which specifies the maximum gas price to bump to|
|`_subscriptionId`|`uint256`|The subscription ID that this contract uses for funding VRF requests|


### nextSalt

Increments the salt one step.


```solidity
function nextSalt() public;
```

### createRaffle

Creates new `Raffl` contracts.
Requirements:
- `underlyingTokenAddress` cannot be the zero address.
- `timestamps` must be given in ascending order.
- `percentages` must be given in ascending order and the last one must always be 1 eth, where 1 eth equals to
100%.


```solidity
function createRaffle(
    address entryToken,
    uint256 entryPrice,
    uint256 minEntries,
    uint256 deadline,
    IRaffl.Prize[] calldata prizes,
    IRaffl.TokenGate[] calldata tokenGates,
    IRaffl.ExtraRecipient calldata extraRecipient
)
    external
    payable
    returns (address raffle);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`entryToken`|`address`|       The address of the ERC-20 token as entry. If address zero, entry is the network token|
|`entryPrice`|`uint256`|       The value of each entry for the raffle.|
|`minEntries`|`uint256`|       The minimum number of entries to consider make the draw.|
|`deadline`|`uint256`|         The block timestamp until the raffle will receive entries and that will perform the draw if criteria is met.|
|`prizes`|`IRaffl.Prize[]`|           The prizes that will be held by this contract.|
|`tokenGates`|`IRaffl.TokenGate[]`|       The token gating that will be imposed to users.|
|`extraRecipient`|`IRaffl.ExtraRecipient`|   The extra recipient that will share the rewards (optional).|


### activeRaffles

Exposes the `ActiveRaffle`s


```solidity
function activeRaffles() public view returns (ActiveRaffle[] memory);
```

### handleSubscription

Sets the Chainlink VRF subscription settings


```solidity
function handleSubscription(
    uint64 _subscriptionId,
    bytes32 _keyHash,
    uint32 _callbackGasLimit,
    uint16 _requestConfirmations
)
    external
    onlyOwner;

### checkUpkeep

Method called by the Chainlink Automation Nodes to check if `performUpkeep` must be done.

*Performs the computation to the array of `_activeRaffles`. This opens the possibility of having several
checkUpkeeps done at the same time.*

**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`upkeepNeeded`|`bool`|Whether the upkeep must be performed or not|
|`performData`|`bytes`|Encoded binary data which contains the raffle address and index of the `_activeRaffles`|


### performUpkeep

Permissionless write method usually called by the Chainlink Automation Nodes.

*Either starts the draw for a raffle or cancels the raffle if criteria is not met.*


```solidity
function performUpkeep(bytes calldata performData) external override;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`performData`|`bytes`|Encoded binary data which contains the raffle address and index of the `_activeRaffles`|


### fulfillRandomWords

```
**Parameters**

|----|----|-----------|
|`requestId`|`uint256`|Id of the VRF request|
|`randomWords`|`uint256[]`|Provably fair and verifiable array of random words|


### _burnActiveRaffle

*Move the last element to the deleted stop and removes the last element*


```solidity
function _burnActiveRaffle(uint256 i) internal;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|

### setFeeCollector
