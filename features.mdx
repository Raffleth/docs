- **Set Draw Date:** Choose the date for your raffle draw to add anticipation and excitement for your participants.

- **Prize Specification:** Specify the prizes for your raffle. You can choose any combination of ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens to make your prizes more appealing and varied.

- **Decentralized Draw Mechanism:** We use the Chainlink oracle for a decentralized and automated draw. This ensures fairness and transparency as the system autonomously selects winners without any bias.

- **User-friendly Interface:** Our platform has an easy-to-use interface for creating and managing raffles, making it accessible and convenient for everyone.

- **Secure and Transparent:** Raffl provides a secure raffle/lottery mechanism on the Ethereum blockchain. All transactions and draws are transparent and can be independently verified for fairness.

- **Token Gating:** With Raffl, you can restrict participation in your raffles to holders of specific tokens. This allows you to create exclusive raffles for your token community.

Raffl's suite of features is designed to make the process of creating and participating in raffles easy, fun, and secure.
